# Introduction

Apache OpenWhiskâ„¢ is an open source, distributed Serverless computing project.

Specifically, it is able to execute application logic (*Actions*) in response to events (*Triggers*) from external sources (*Feeds*) governed by simple conditional logic (*Rules*) around the event data.

It provides a programming model for registering and managing *Actions*, *Triggers* and *Rules* supported by a REST-based Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and catalog services.

The project includes a catalog of built-in system and utility *Actions* and *Feeds*, along with a robust set of samples that demonstrate how to integrate OpenWhisk with various external service providers (e.g., GitHub, Slack, etc.) along with several platform and run-time Software
Development Kits (SDKs).

The code for the Actions, along with any support services implementing *Feeds*, are packaged according to this specification to be compatible with the OpenWhisk catalog and its tooling. It also serves as a means for architects and developers to model OpenWhisk package Actions as part
of full, event-driven services and applications providing the necessary information for artifact and data type validation along with package management operations.

## Compatibility

This specification is intended to be compatible with the following specifications:

- *OpenWhisk API which is defined as an OpenAPI document:*
    - <https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/core/controller/src/main/resources/apiv1swagger.json>

- *OpenAPI Specification when defining REST APIs and parameters:*
    - <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md>
