## Rules

The Rule entity schema contains the information necessary to associates one trigger with one action, with every firing of the trigger causing the corresponding action to be invoked with the trigger event as input. For more information, see the document "[Creating Triggers and Rules](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/triggers_rules.md)".

### Requirements
- The Rule name (i.e., <ruleName>) MUST be less than or equal to 256 characters.
- The Rule entity schema includes all general [Entity Schema](#TBD) fields in addition to any fields
declared above.

### Notes
- OpenWhisk only supports a value of '```true```' for the '```rule```' key's value at this time.

### Grammar
```yaml
<ruleName>:
  description: <string>
  trigger: <string>
  action: <string>
  rule: <regex>
```

### Example

```yaml
my_rule:
  description: Enable events for my Action
  trigger: my_trigger
  action: my_action
```
