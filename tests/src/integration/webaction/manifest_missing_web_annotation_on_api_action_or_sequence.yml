# TODO automate this testcase
# Test automatically adding web annotations on Actions that do not have them declared
# when these actions are used to create APIs.
# 1) Test an Action missing web-export, but with existing Annotations declared
# 2) Test a Sequence missing web-export with NO existing Annotations (to verify we allocate)
# 3) Test if web-action is set to false that we error out as we cannot override explicit value
